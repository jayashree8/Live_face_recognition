# Face recognition along with liveness detection

## Steps:

1) Run "register.py" file to save images in the dataset folder. The "register.py" file automatically divides the images into train and test data.

2) Run the python notebook to train the model on the new images just added. 

3) Save the model and download the model.

4) Run the "test.py" file for testing purposes.

Note: 1) Make sure the images are taken in good lighting otherwise poor results will be obtained.
      2) Make sure the "shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat_2" in in the same folder as the "test.py" file.
